## Architecture Patterns

### Walking Skeleton Methodology
1. **Milestone 1**: End-to-end connectivity (Frontend → API → DB → Cache)
2. **Milestone 2**: Authentication + core business logic
3. **Milestone 3+**: Layer features incrementally

### 12-Factor Agent Principles
See [Agent 12-Factors](agent-12-factors.md) for the complete philosophy and [Agent Architecture](agent-architecture.md) for implementation details.

## Security & Compliance

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Current Implementation**: Local JWT-based authentication
  - Username/password with bcrypt hashing (cost factor 12)
  - Email verification for registration and password reset
  - JWT tokens (7-day expiry) signed with SECRET_KEY
  - Session management via localStorage
- **Planned Enhancements**:
  - Add OAuth2/OIDC providers (Microsoft, Google) for social login
  - Support multiple auth providers based on user region
  - Add MFA (TOTP) for enhanced security
  - Implement refresh tokens for better session management
- **Design Decision**: Separate pods architecture chosen over multi-container pods
  - Avoids OAuth complexity for MVP phase
  - Allows independent scaling and updates
  - Provides adequate security for initial user base (<10K users)

### Network Security
- HTTPS/TLS encryption (Let's Encrypt)
- Azure CNI networking
- Network policies
- VPN for cross-cloud communication

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest (Cosmos DB, OSS)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Secrets management via Azure Key Vault
- External Secrets Operator for K8s integration

### Compliance
- No hardcoded secrets in manifests
- Audit logging
- RBAC with minimal permissions
- Signed container images

## Scalability & Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless application design
- Kubernetes HPA for automatic scaling
- Load balancing via Nginx Ingress
- Distributed caching with Redis

### Performance Optimization
- CDN for static assets
- Redis caching for market data
- Async/await throughout backend
- Connection pooling for databases
- Image optimization for charts

### Cost Optimization
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Managed services reduce operational overhead
- Development environment with minimal resources
- CDN reduces bandwidth costs

## Deployment Topology

### Pod Architecture (All Environments)
```
┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐
│  Frontend   │   │  Backend    │   │   Redis     │
│    Pod      │   │    Pod      │   │    Pod      │
│             │   │             │   │             │
│  Replicas:  │   │  Replicas:  │   │  Replicas:  │
│   3-5       │   │   2-3       │   │   1         │
└─────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘
      ↓                 ↓                  ↓
  Service           Service            Service
   (ClusterIP)       (ClusterIP)       (ClusterIP)
```

**Why Separate Pods?**
1. **Independent Scaling**: Frontend scales 3-5x during market hours, backend 2-3x for LLM load, Redis stays at 1
2. **Zero-Downtime Updates**: Update backend without restarting frontend/Redis
3. **Failure Isolation**: Backend crash doesn't affect frontend UI or Redis cache
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Fine-grained CPU/memory limits per service
5. **Monitoring**: Easy to identify which component is unhealthy

**Not Using Multi-Container Pods Because:**
- ❌ All containers restart when any one fails
- ❌ Can't scale components independently
- ❌ Updates require full pod restart (Redis cache lost)
- ❌ Resource limits shared across all containers

### Environments

| Environment | Platform | URL | Status |
|-------------|----------|-----|--------|
| **Local Dev** | Docker Compose | http://localhost:3000 | Active |
| **Test** | Azure AKS | https://klinematrix.com | Planned |
| **Prod** | Alibaba ACK (Shanghai) | https://klinecubic.cn | Active |

## Integration Points

### Cross-Cloud Integration
1. **Authentication Flow**: JWT → AKS → Services
2. **Data Flow**: Azure Cosmos DB ↔ Application ↔ Alibaba OSS
3. **AI Processing**: Application → Qwen-VL Model → Response
4. **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor + custom metrics from Alibaba services
